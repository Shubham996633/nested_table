# Shadcn Nested Data Table
@shadcn

## Overview

This repository contains a custom implementation of a nested data table built using [Shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) components. As of now, there isn't an official or widely available implementation of a nested data table with Shadcn, so I took the initiative to create one.

## Features

- **Nested Rows:** Expandable and collapsible rows to display hierarchical data.
- **Customizable Columns:** Easily configure the columns to fit your data structure.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth interaction even with large datasets.
